# Converting tensors


## Transforming a tensor from `numpy` and viceversa
* Explain how transform a tensor back and forth to `numpy`.
* Why is this important?
* In what cases in this necessary?


### Convert a tensor to `numpy` object
This is a frequent operation. I have found that this is necessary when:

* a `numpy` function is not implemented in PyTorch
* We need to convert a tensor to R
* Perform a boolean operation that is not directly available in PyTorch


### Convert a `numpy` object to an `R` object
This is mainly required for these reasons:

1. Create a data structure in R
2. Plot using `r-base` or `ggplot2`
3. Perform an analysis on parts of a tensor
4. Use R statistical functions that are not available in PyTorch


## Transforming a tensor from PyTorch to R and viceversa

```{python}
import torch
import torchvision

torch.nn
torchvision.transforms
torchvision.datasets
```
